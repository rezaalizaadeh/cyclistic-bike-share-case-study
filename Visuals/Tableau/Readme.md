## Why the .twbx File Is Not Included?

The Tableau packaged workbook (`.twbx`) is about **125 MB**, which exceeds GitHub’s **100 MB** maximum file size limit.  
For this reason, the workbook itself is not stored in this repository.

However, the full interactive dashboard is publicly available through the Tableau Public link above.
